### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am a fifth year student pursuing a BS-MS degree in Physics at IISER Mohali. 

I enjoy implementing computational models of physical phenomena and creating interactive simulations. Currently I'm working on my MS thesis with [Dr. Sanjeev Kumar](https://www.iisermohali.ac.in/awards-recognitions/dps/dr-sanjeev-kumar) and [Prof. Tilman Pfau's group](https://www.pi5.uni-stuttgart.de/institute/team/) broadly involving quantum simulations using ultracold atoms trapped in optical lattices.
