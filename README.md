### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Akshay!
I'm a physics PhD student at [QuantumGroup@UGent](https://quantumghent.github.io/) with an interest in exotic BEC physics and programming. I am currently working on utilizing Tensor Network techniques to study BEC systems in the context of quantum simulation experiments. 

When I'm not performing research, I enjoy developing interactive simulations of higher level concepts in physics, as well as occasionally making games with the [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org/).
